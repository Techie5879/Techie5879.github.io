        I'm a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer fascinated by mechanistic interpretability, computer vision and information retrieval! Trying to exploring the inner workings of language models to make AI more transparent, and understanding what kind of algorithms they are capable of learning. In the medical domain, I'm excited to develop computer vision techniques to analyze medical images and improve healthcare. Information retrieval is another passion - having worked on it for more than a year. So now I have these 3 very different fields of AI I'm trying to explore - another reason why I am never bored!

        Always on the lookout for collaborators, so feel free to shoot me an email!
