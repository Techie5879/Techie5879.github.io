      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome to my digital corner! I'm a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer, currently working as a DAAD WISE Scholar at TUM's CAMP Research Group. I've previously worked as an ML Engineer at Mercor and dove into research at IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at IIEST Shibpur, I'm fascinated by Mechanistic Interpretability, Computer Vision, LLMs, and Quantum Computing.
