## About Me

Welcome to my digital corner! I'm a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer, currently working as a DAAD WISE Scholar at TUM's CAMP Research Group. I've previously worked as an ML Engineer at Mercor and dove into research at IIT Kharagpur and ISI Kolkata. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at IIEST Shibpur, I'm fascinated by Mechanistic Interpretability, Computer Vision, LLMs, and Quantum Computing.
